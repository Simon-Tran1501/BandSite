        We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for one of us to
        say ‘this needs to be better, back to the drawing board’”** - Bryan
        Teddy, lead vocalist of The Bees Knees

      <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
      <p>
        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
        California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
        Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer
        Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an
        unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked
        with other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The
        Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even further,
        pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.
